# States
States are micro-interactions in UI elements, that add value to your product by giving the user a feedback and improve the user experience. States refer to the different forms an element can take, based on the context that it is being used in.

> Some components may not feature all states mentioned here. For detailed information on the available states and options of a specific component, refer to the documentation page dedicated to that component.

## Types

### Default
This is the standard state of a component when it is first rendered, representing its base appearance and functionality.
