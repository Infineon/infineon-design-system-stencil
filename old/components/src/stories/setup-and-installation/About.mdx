# About

As part of the Infineon brand guidelines, the Infineon Digital Design System has been developed to support designers, developers, and project managers in creating consistent and intuitive user interfaces.

Our design system offers a wide range of reusable UI components, design patterns, and guidelines to facilitate faster and more efficient development.

We strive to create a seamless user experience across all internal and external Infineon digital touchpoints, streamlining the development process and ultimately helping the organization to achieve its goals.

By utilizing our design system, users can focus on delivering high-quality, user-centric digital experiences that align with Infineon's brand identity and values.

Our [Github repository](https://github.com/Infineon/infineon-design-system-stencil) contains an implementation of Infineons Digital Design System, the Storybook sourcecode, as well as some example applications demonstrating the usage of the web components.

### Built With
