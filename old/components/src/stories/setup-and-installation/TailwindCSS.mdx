# Using Tailwind CSS with our Design System

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a popular, highly customizable, and widely-used utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to write more concise and maintainable code. It provides a set of pre-defined classes to style HTML elements, making it easy to create consistent and responsive user interfaces. With Tailwind CSS, you can focus on building your application's layout and design without worrying about writing custom CSS code.
