## Notes

### Options
The Single Select component takes an array of objects in the following format as input:

```
const options = [{
  value: "a",
  label: "option a",
  selected: false
},
{
  value: "b",
  label: "option b",
  selected: false
},
{
  value: "c",
  label: "option c",
  selected: false
}];
```

The ``selected`` property can be used to predefine an option as selected. 
(``selected: true``)
This property is only changed, when a new option is selected, as the single-select only allows for one selected option.
However, the component only creates a shallow copy of the input array, so the original input array does not change.

### Custom events

This component emits two custom events:
- ``Ã¬fxInput`` 
  - Accessing the detail property of this custom event returns the search string
  - gets emitted every time the user types into the search field
- ``ifxSelect`` 
  - Accessing the detail property of this custom event returns an object, containing the ``value`` and ``label`` property of the selected option
  - gets emitted when an item is selected
