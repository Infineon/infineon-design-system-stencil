# Breadcrumb
Breadcrumbs are a navigational aid that provides users with a hierarchical trail of links, allowing them to understand their current location within a website or application.

## Usage

### When to use
- When your website or application has a hierarchical structure, such as categories, subcategories, and pages.
- If users need to navigate through multiple levels to access specific information.

### When not to use
- If your website has a simple and shallow structure with only a few levels.

## Mouse interaction
Every single breadcrumb link is clickable. The page the user is currently on is not clickable. This page is characterised by the fact that it does not have an underlined style. The click area corresponds to the text width and line height. Dropdown icons have a separate link area.
