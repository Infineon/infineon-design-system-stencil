# Segmented Control
A segmented control is a horizontal set of three or more segments, each functioning as a mutually exclusive button. It allows users to toggle between different views or states within the same context without leaving the current screen.

## Usage
### When to use
- When users need to select one option from a small set (up to six) of related, mutually exclusive choices.
- When toggling between different views or data representations within the same context.

### When not to use
- When the number of options exceeds six. Use a dropdown menu instead.
- For actions that perform functions like "Add" or "Edit". Use buttons for such actions instead.
- When each option leads to entirely different views or pages.

> We recommend to use a maximum set of six controls.
