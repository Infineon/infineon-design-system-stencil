## Notes

As of now, our Stencil component for pagination offers only one possible option for the "Results per Page" setting. 
This setting refers to the number of items displayed per page in a paginated list. 
The next version of our component will provide multiple options for the per-page setting in order to improve the usability and user experience of the pagination component.
