# Filter Type Group

The Filter Type Group component is used within the table component, when filtering is enabled and the filter-orientation is set to 'sidebar'.
It consists of an ``Ã¬fx-filter-search`` component and a list of filters of type ``checkbox``, ``radio-button``.
These filters are grouped within one or multiple ```ifx-filter-accordion``` component(s), which can be expanded and collapsed.
The ```ifx-filter-accordion``` contains an ``ifx-list`` component, which contains a number of ```ifx-list-entry``` components, which can then be selected to filter the table data.
Each ``ifx-list`` has a ``type`` property, which defaults to ``checkbox``.
