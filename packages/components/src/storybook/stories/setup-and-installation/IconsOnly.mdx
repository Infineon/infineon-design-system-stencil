# Icons Only Usage

If you only need icons, you have three approaches. Choose the one that matches your performance, customization, and bundle size goals.

## Option 1: `ifx-icon` web component (selective import)

Use this when you want the Design System icon API and consistency without loading all components. This setup uses the web component `defineCustomElement` import (not a framework wrapper).

### Benefits

- Smaller bundle size when only icons are needed
- Easy to scale to more components later 

### Setup 
First, install the package: 

<PackageManagerTabs packageName="@infineon/infineon-design-system-stencil" /> 

Then import only the `ifx-icon` web component in your entry point file:
```javascript
// main.ts, main.js, or index.ts
import { defineCustomElement as defineCustomElementIfxIcon } from '@infineon/infineon-design-system-stencil/dist/components/ifx-icon';

defineCustomElementIfxIcon(window);
```

## Option 2: SVG

Use this when you want fine-grained control over icon color or when you only need a few icons. The example below shows CDN usage; bundler setup depends on your bundler.

### Usage

```html
<img
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@infineon/infineon-icons/svg/chip-16.svg"
  width="16"
  height="16"
  alt=""
/>
```

### Pros

- Color customization is possible with SVG
- Better performance on initial load when only a few icons are used

### Cons

- One HTTP request per icon (even when cached, still needs validation)

## Option 3: Icon font

Use this when you want to load many icons with minimal markup and a single cached asset. The example below shows CDN usage; bundler setup depends on your bundler.

### Usage

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@infineon/infineon-icons/dist/chipfonts/infineon-icons.css"
  />
</head>
<body>
  <span class="icon icon-chip" aria-hidden="true"></span>
</body>
```

### Pros

- Font gets cached
- Reduced amount of code per icon

### Cons

- Risk of icon flickering while the font loads
- Risk of rendering as a random character if the font download fails
- Accessibility requires `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons

## Available Icons

Browse all available icons in the [Icon documentation](./?path=/docs/icon-library--development).

## Adding More Components Later

If you later decide you need additional components, you can either:

1. Add individual components using the same selective import pattern
2. Switch to the full library by following the complete installation guide for your framework

## Note

When using selective imports, only import the components you actually use to maintain the benefits of reduced bundle size.
