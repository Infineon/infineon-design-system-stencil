# React + Stencil

Stencil generates standard web components that are framework-agnostic. These are "vanilla" components that can be used with any JavaScript framework, or without a framework at all.

React Wrappers: Similarly to Vue, a React wrapper provides a React interface to a Stencil web component, making the web component feel more like a typical React component. This includes proper handling of props, state, and events within the context of a React application.

The wrapper components are not a necessity but they provide a more idiomatic and pleasant developer experience within the respective frameworks. They translate the native framework usage to the underlying Stencil component.
