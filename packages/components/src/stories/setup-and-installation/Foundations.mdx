# Border radius 
A fundamental aspect of our visual design. 
It refers to the curvature applied to the corners of elements, such as buttons, cards, or containers. 
It shapes the overall aesthetic and feel of our interfaces, influencing user perception and interaction.  

## 1px border radius 
<img src={BorderRadius1px} alt="BorderRadius1px" /> 
We use a 1px border radius for all rectangular objects in our design system.
This includes buttons, text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and other rectangular elements. 
A 1px border radius creates a slight curve at the corners of these elements, which softens their appearance and helps creating a more friendly and approachable design. 

<img src={BorderRadius1px} alt="Border Radius 1px" />   

## 9999px border radius 
<img src={BorderRadius9999px} alt="BorderRadius9999px" /> 

In addition to the 1px border radius, we use a 9999px border radius for certain components in our design system. 
These components include chips, tags, toggles, and filter components. 
This style creates a pill shape for these elements, which helps distinguish them from other rectangular elements on the page and makes them more visually appealing. 



 # Grid 
 Our grid system provides a set of grid variants and a structure for laying out content. 
 This structure helps to maintain consistency and harmony throughout the design, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the content.  
 
 ## Base grid unit 
The base grid unit for our design system is 8px. 
This means that all grid measurements, such as column width, gutter width, and margin/padding values, are multiples of 8.  

## Grid variants 
Our design system includes three different grid variants which are optimized for different types of content and use cases  

### Marketing Grid 
The Marketing Grid is designed to showcase marketing content. 
It is available for all breakpoints, including XS, S, M, L and XL.

# Iconography 
Icons play a crucial role in our design system, providing visual representation and enhancing user experiences. 
We primarily utilize the Nucleo icon library for our icons, ensuring consistency and a wide range of options.  


## Usage  
 
### When to use 
 
- Icons can be used alongside text to aid navigation and improve usability. They can represent different sections, categories, or actions, making it easier for users to identify and interact with them. 
- If you want to communicate actions, such as saving, deleting, editing, or sharing. 
By utilizing recognizable icons, users can quickly understand the purpose or functionality associated with a specific action.  

### When not to use 
- If an icon's meaning is unclear or open to interpretation, it is best to use descriptive text instead. Clarity and understanding should always take precedence over aesthetic considerations. 
- Avoid overcrowding interfaces with too many icons, as this can lead to visual clutter and confusion. Strive for a balanced composition that maintains a clean and intuitive design.  

## Size 
To ensure consistency and alignment, we utilize a 4px grid size for our icons. 
This grid aligns with the overall design system and facilitates seamless integration into our interfaces. We have established four fixed icon sizes: 12×12px, 16×16px, and 24×24px. 
Choose the appropriate size based on the context and surrounding elements. > Icons within our DDS components come with the right icon size out of the box!  

<img src={IconSizes} alt="Icon Sizes" />  

## Structure All our icon sizes include the icon itself and the surrounding area. 

<img src={IconStructure} alt="Icon Structure" width="50%"/> 

## Variants 
 
The DDS provides two different kinds of icons: outlined and filled.

<img src={IconVariants} alt="Icon Variants" width="50%" />  
 
## Alignment with text  
 
### Size alignment 
Try to pair specific typographic styles with corresponding icon sizes. 
The body-03 and body-04 typographic style is well-suited for 16px icons, while larger typography, such as the heading-04, works best with 24px icons. 
 
<img src={IconSizeAlignment} alt="Icon Size Alignment" width="50%" />  
 
### Vertical alignment 
Icons should be vertically aligned with the accompanying text or other related elements. Centered aligned icons of adjacent text helps to maintain visual harmony and improves readability. 
 
<img src={IconAlignment} alt="Icon Alignment" width="50%" />  
 
### Text color alignment 
Icons should be aligned with the text color they accompany. Ensure that icons adhere to the same color scheme as the surrounding text to create a unified and visually pleasing user experience. 

<img src={IconTextColorAlignment} alt="Icon Text Color Alignment" width="50%" /> 

## Color  
 
### Dark font color 
The black font color is the default color for icons. We use this color in most cases on `base-white` or `Cengineering-100` backgrounds. 
 
<img src={IconTextColorDark} alt="Icon Text Color Dark" width="50%" />  
 
### White font color 
We use the `base-white` color on dark backgrounds. 
 
<img src={IconTextColorWhite} alt="Icon Text Color White" width="50%" />  
 
### Brand font color
We use our brand color `ocean-500` to highlight the content or actions connected with the icon. Use it on white or `engineering-100` backgrounds. 
  
<img src={IconTextColorBrand} alt="Icon Text Color Brand" width="50%" />
