 # Grid 
 Our grid system provides a set of grid variants and a structure for laying out content. 
 This structure helps to maintain consistency and harmony throughout the design, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the content.  
 
 ## Base grid unit 
The base grid unit for our design system is 8px. 
This means that all grid measurements, such as column width, gutter width, and margin/padding values, are multiples of 8.  

## Grid variants 
Our design system includes three different grid variants which are optimized for different types of content and use cases
