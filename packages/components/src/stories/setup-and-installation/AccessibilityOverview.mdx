# Accessibility guidelines
We want to enable as many people as possible to use our interfaces. 
The Infineon DDS is designed according to WCAG 2.0 Level AA. Please optimize all user interfaces for at least this level of accessibility.

  style={{
    'aspect-ratio': '1098 / 373',
    'object-fit': 'cover',  // This will crop the image to fit
    'width': '100%'         // Optional: make it responsive
  }}

## Introduction
<div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '3fr 2fr', gap: '24px', alignItems: 'start', margin: '24px 0' }}>
    <div>
    All DDS components are designed and developed following the global <strong style={{ color: '#0A8276' }}>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Level AA</strong>. 
    The DDS is providing and experience which is <strong style={{ color: '#0A8276' }}>Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust</strong>.  
    Anticipating a wide range of human experiences and disabilities prevents costly redesigns, reduces tech and design debt, and conserves resources upfront.

### Color and contrast
Text and user interface components on a page must meet a specific minimum contrast ratio to pass WCAG 2.2 AA standards. 
Why? People with low vision may have trouble reading or understanding important information. Depending on the contrast ratio, users may not see the item at all. 
Besides being perceived as disabled items, this makes users struggle with actions like making sure they select the correct option.

    <div>
        <img src={ColorContrastEngineering100}></img>
        <ul style={{ marginTop: '12px' }}>
            <li>Normal text (14pt): 4.5:1 minimum contrast</li>
            <li>Large text (14pt bold+, 18pt+): 3:1 minimum contrast</li>
            <li>Graphical objects & UI components: 3:1 minimum contrast</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ color: '#4B5563', fontSize: '14px' }}>
        Note: Disabled controls do not need to hit any specific contrast levels.

<img src={UseOfColor}></img>
The main point in the guideline 1.4.1 Use of Color is to make sure that color isn't the sole identifier. 
If you have an important transition that is only a change in color, make sure that color change has a 3:1 contrast ratio.

A great way to test for this is to navigate that experience in greyscale mode.

## Typography and Readability
Purpose: Ensure all text is legible and readable.

Content:
* Minimum sizes: 16px for body, 14px for dense UI.
* Line height and spacing: Minimum 1.5 line-height, sufficient letter spacing.
* Avoid light weights: Maintain sufficient stroke contrast.
* Text hierarchy: Use heading styles (H1–H3) consistently.
* Avoid text inside images.

Relevant WCAG References:
* 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) – Contrast between text and background.
* 1.4.4 Resize Text – Text must be readable when scaled to 200%.
* 1.4.8 Visual Presentation (AAA) – Line height, spacing, and text width recommendations.
* 1.3.1 Info and Relationships – Use headings and structure to express hierarchy

## States, Focus and Interactions
Purpose: Make interactive components perceivable, operable, and consistent.

Content:
* Interactive states: Default / Hover / Active / Focus / Disabled — each visually distinct.
* Focus visibility: Always provide a clear focus indicator.
* Touch targets: Minimum 44 × 44 px for all actionable elements.
* Reduced motion: Respect prefers-reduced-motion for users sensitive to animation.

Relevant WCAG References:
* 2.4.7 Focus Visible – Focus indicators must be visible.
* 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced) – Interactive areas must be at least 44 × 44 px.
* 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions – Allow users to disable motion.
* 2.4.3 Focus Order – Logical tab and focus sequence.

## Icons and Visual indicators
Purpose: Support meaning through icons and visuals — not rely solely on them.

Content:
* Icons with text labels: Always include descriptive text where appropriate.
* No color-only cues: Combine with shape, label, or icon variation.
* Consistent meaning: Use icons consistently across the system.
* Tooltips: Provide context when an icon alone may not be clear.

Relevant WCAG References:
* 1.4.1 Use of Color – Color cannot be the only method of communication.
* 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics – Instructions should not rely solely on shape, size, or visual position.
* 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions – Provide clear labeling for user understanding.

## Content and Structure
Purpose: Make content clear, logical, and semantically structured.

Content:
* Plain language: Use simple, clear, and concise text.
* Descriptive labels: Buttons, links, and inputs must describe their purpose.
* Logical hierarchy: Use heading levels and consistent layout structure.
* Alternative text: Provide text alternatives for images, icons, and infographics.

Relevant WCAG References:
* 1.1.1 Non-Text Content – All non-text content must have a text alternative.
* 1.3.1 Info and Relationships – Use structure and hierarchy meaningfully.
* 2.4.6 Headings and Labels – Descriptive headings and labels.
* 3.1.5 Reading Level (AAA) – Use language that is easy to understand.
