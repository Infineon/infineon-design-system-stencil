## Developing an accessible website
When developing a website, it is important to ensure that it is accessible to all users. This includes users with disabilities, such as visual impairments, hearing impairments, and motor impairments. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a set of guidelines for creating accessible websites. The guidelines are organized into four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Each principle has a set of guidelines and success criteria that websites must meet to be considered accessible.
