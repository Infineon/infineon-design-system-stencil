# Vue + Stencil

Vue Wrappers: A Vue wrapper is a Vue-specific interface for a Stencil-generated web component. It offers a bridge between Stencil and Vue, enabling more native Vue syntax, such as Vue's event handling and property binding. This makes it easier to use Stencil components in a Vue app. Stencil generates these wrappers when configured to do so.

We have added some additional configuration to support the use of Vue's v-model.
Currently this works with the `IfxProgressBar`, the `IfxSearchBar` and the `IfxSearchInput`.

## Installation

**1.**

**- with NPM**

`npm install @infineon/infineon-design-system-vue`

**- with Yarn**

`yarn add @infineon/infineon-design-system-vue`

**2. Installation of SASS**

```bash
npm install sass
```

**3. Import the module inside your entry point file**

```js
//main.js/main.ts
import { ComponentLibrary } from '@infineon/infineon-design-system-vue';
//...

createApp(App).use(ComponentLibrary).mount('#app');
```

In Vue, this registers the components globally.

## Usage

### Components

```js
<ifx-progress-bar v-model="progress" size="m" show-label="true"></ifx-progress-bar>
```

### Events

#### Two way data binding

Two-way binding means that any data-related changes affecting the model are immediately propagated to the matching view(s).
And any changes made in the view(s) are immediately reflected in the underlying model.
When app data changes, so does the UI, and conversely.

```js
//MyComponent.vue
let textValue = ref('');
...
<ifx-text-field @ifxInput="event => textValue = event.detail" :value="textValue">
</ifx-text-field>
```

In Vue, the <b>v-model</b> directive helps to simplify this.

```js
//MyComponent.vue
let textValue = ref('');
...
<ifx-text-field v-model="textValue"></ifx-text-field>
```

### Assets

To include images or other assets in your web application, there are different possiblities to achieve this in Vue.
Some of these possibilities are listed below.

* Assets need to be in the public directory.
  Images in this directory will be served at the root path, so you only need:

```js
// '/' + your image path
<img src="/circle.svg">
```

* Import files individually

```
import img from '../assets/coffee_unsplash.jpg'

 <img :src="img">
```
