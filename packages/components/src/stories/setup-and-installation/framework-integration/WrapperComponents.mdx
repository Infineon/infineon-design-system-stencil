# Wrapper Components vs "Vanilla" Web Components

"Standard" Web Components (also often referred to as "Vanilla" Web Components) are reusable custom HTML elements built using the native Custom Elements and Shadow DOM APIs provided by the browser. They're platform-agnostic and can be used in any JavaScript environment that supports these APIs.

Wrapper components, on the other hand, are adaptations of these standard Web Components for specific JavaScript frameworks, like React or Vue. They allow the Web Components to interact more seamlessly with the patterns and APIs of these frameworks, enhancing their usability and compatibility in these contexts.

The wrapper components are not a necessity but they provide a more idiomatic and pleasant developer experience within the respective frameworks. They translate the native framework usage to the underlying Stencil component.
