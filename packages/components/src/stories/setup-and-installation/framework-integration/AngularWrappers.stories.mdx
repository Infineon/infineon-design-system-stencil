# Angular + Stencil

Angular Wrappers: Similarly to Vue and React, an Angular wrapper provides an Angular interface to a Stencil web component, making the web component feel more like a typical Angular component. This includes proper handling of props, state, and events within the context of an Angular application.

## Installation

**1.**

**- with NPM**

```npm install @infineon/infineon-design-system-angular```

**- with Yarn**

```yarn add @infineon/infineon-design-system-angular```

**2. Installation of SASS**
```bash
npm install sass
```


**3. Import the module inside your entry point file**


```js
import { defineCustomElements } from '@infineon/infineon-design-system-angular';
//...

defineCustomElements(window)
```

In Angular, there isn't a built-in mechanism to globally register components like in Vue. Therefore, components need to be imported in the file that they are being used in.

## Usage

```js
import { IfxProgressBar, IfxSearchBar, IfxButton } from '@infineon/infineon-design-system-angular';
//...
<IfxSearchBar onIfxChange={handleSearch} style={{ width: '100%' }} show-close-button="true"></IfxSearchBar>
```

**Angular + Javascript specific**

It may be necessary to add the following to your .env file at project root:

``GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false``

This can also be achieved by updating your start script in the ``package.json`` accordingly.
