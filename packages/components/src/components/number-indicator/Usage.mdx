# Number Indicator
The number indicator component refers to some of our UI elements that visually represents or displays numeric information to users.

## When to use
- If you want to display the count of items in a list or container, like the number of items in a shopping cart or the unread emails in an inbox.
- If you want to inform the user about new notification e.g. messages.
- If the user has selected many options and these can no longer be displayed due to lack of space.

## When not to use
- If you want to use it as different style for a numbered list. Use an icon or native numbered list style instead.

## Variants
The number indicator component can be used in different use cases. As a counter in a shopping cart, or as indicator for unseen items. The "+" affix communicates to users that there are additional selected options beyond what's currently visible.
