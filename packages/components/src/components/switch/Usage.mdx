# Switch
The switch component allows users to toggle between two mutually exclusive states (on/off or yes/no). It always has a default value.

## Usage

### When to use
- When you need to provide users with a straightforward and intuitive way to toggle between two states, such as enabling or disabling a feature or setting.
- When the binary nature of the choice is clear, and there is no need for additional options or complex interactions.

### When not to use
- If you have more complex options or a range of values, alternative UI elements like radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, or sliders might be more suitable.

**Switch(1)**
The main part of the component

**Switch Action Label (2)**
Describes the action which can be done by the user. Since the shwitch should represent the two actions (on/off or yes/no), the action label can also be disabled. 

## Mouse interaction
To check the switch, users have two options: they can either directly click on the switch or click on the action label.
