**Collapsed State (3)**\
A chevron-down icon indicates that the panel is collapsed.


**Expanded State (4)**\
A chevron-up icon indicates that the panel is collapsed.


**Panel (5)**\
Panels are the content that appears when the user clicks on a header. They can contain text, images, or other types of content. Panels are hidden by default, and they only become visible when the user clicks on the corresponding header.


**Container (6)**\
The container is the outermost element that contains all the accordion components. The container's role is to provide a visual boundary for the accordion and to group all the headers and panels together.
