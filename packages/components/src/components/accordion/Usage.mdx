# Accordion
The accordion component allows users to expand and collapse content within a webpage or application. This component is commonly used for organizing and presenting large amounts of information in a compact and user-friendly manner.

## Usage

### When to use
- Frequently asked questions, product features, and other types of content where space is at a premium.

### When not to use
- If the content within the accordion is critical and necessary for users to see. Instead place the content directly on the page.
- If the content within the accordion is brief.
- If there is only one section of content that needs to be displayed.

**Header (1)**\
Headers are the clickable elements that users can interact with to expand or collapse the accordion panel content. They consists of a Label and a Icon-Button on the left side.


**Accordion Label Text (2)**\
Describes the content within the panel.


**Collapsed State (3)**\
A chevron-down icon indicates that the panel is collapsed.


**Expanded State (4)**\
A chevron-up icon indicates that the panel is collapsed.


**Panel (5)**\
Panels are the content that appears when the user clicks on a header. They can contain text, images, or other types of content. Panels are hidden by default, and they only become visible when the user clicks on the corresponding header.


**Container (6)**\
The container is the outermost element that contains all the accordion components. The container's role is to provide a visual boundary for the accordion and to group all the headers and panels together.
