#  Popover

Popover reveals brief helper content anchored to a specific element. It is activated by a user click and stays attached to that element without disabling the main window. It provides short, contextual guidance and can be closed again by the user if desired.

##  Usage

###  When to use

- When you need to present brief, contextual information tied to a specific element, shown on user click.

- When you want to provide lightweight actions (buttons or links) closely related to the trigger.

- When the content should appear adjacent to its anchor and be easily dismissible without blocking the main interface.

- When you want to reduce visual clutter by deferring secondary details until the user requests them.

  

###  When not to use

- For critical alerts or actions that require focused attention or confirmation.

- For complex or multi-step interactions, long or scrollable content, or forms with multiple fields.

- When the information isn't tied to a specific anchor element or needs to remain persistent on the screen.

- For navigation menus, option lists or purely passive hints that appear on hover.
  

##  Anatomy

**Title (1)**\

A short, descriptive heading that names the popover's purpose. Keep it brief to support quick scanning.  
  


**Support text (2)**\

Support text provides brief, contextual guidance or explanation related to the trigger. Use one or two sentences; avoid long paragraphs, lists, or complex layouts.
  
  

**Container (3)**\

The container is the anchored surface that holds all popover content and controls. It appears adjacent to the trigger element, aligns to the chosen placement, remains non-blocking and can be closed by clicking the close icon. 

  

**Close (Dismiss) Icon (4)**\

A dismiss icon in the top-right corner closes the popover. It is recommended when the popover contains interactive elements or when it should persist until explicitly dismissed.

  

**Indicator (5)**\

A directional arrow that visually connects the popover to its trigger.  
  


**Additional interactive elements (6)**\

Optional action area placed at the bottom of the popover. Add either buttons or links that relate directly to the popover content.



## Mouse Interaction

Users dismiss the popover by clicking the close icon in the top-right corner. When present, buttons or links can be clicked to perform actions or navigate.

##  Variants

  
###  Compact

This is the default for brief, contextual help, which shows only the required title and support text.
<img src={PopoverCompact} alt="Popover Compact" width="50%" />

  

###  Dismissible

This variant contains a close icon and stays open until the user dismisses it. It is useful when user interaction is required for a longer duration and/or automatic disappearance is not suitable.
