# Search Field
The search field component is a fundamental element of our design system that allows users to enter search queries to retrieve relevant information from a dataset or database. It enables users to find and filter content efficiently.

## Usage

### When to use
- When your application contains a large amount of content, such as products, articles, or data, and users may need to find specific items quickly.
- When navigation within your application involves multiple layers or categories, a search field can act as a time-saving alternative to browsing.

### When not to use
- When your content or data is minimal and easily navigable.

## Anatomy

**Field (1)**\
The input field allows users to enter search queries.


**Search Icon (2)**\
The search icon signifies the search action.


**Search Label (3)**\
A label provides clarity about what the search field is for. It tells users explicitly that this is a search input, reducing any potential confusion.


**Clear Icon (4)**\
The clear icon lets users quickly clear the search input field.

## States

## Size
There are two search field sizes: 36px and 40px. This will give you more flexibility in structuring layouts due to e.g. different button heights. It's important to maintain uniform field height while combining form elements on a single page.
