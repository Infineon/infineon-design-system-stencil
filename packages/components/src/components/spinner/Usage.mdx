# Spinner
The Spinner component is used to indicate loading or processing states in the user interface. It consists of animated spinners that visually convey ongoing activity.

## Usage

### When to use
- To indicate loading or processing states when fetching data, performing operations, or waiting for content to load.

### When not to use
- When there is no active loading or processing state. Spinners should only be used when there is a need to inform users about ongoing activity.

## Variants

### Default spinner
It is a versatile spinner suitable for various loading processes. It features rounded corners with a 1px border, providing a clean and modern appearance.
