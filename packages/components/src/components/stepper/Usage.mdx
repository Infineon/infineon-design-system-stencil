# Stepper
The stepper guides users through a step-by-step process. It provides a clear visual representation of progress and allows users to navigate between steps.

## Usage

### When to use
- When you have a multi-step process or task that needs to be visually represented and guided.
- If you need to simplify complex workflows by breaking them down into manageable steps.
- When you need to provide users with a clear sense of progress and to keep them engaged in the process.

### When not to use
- For simple, single-step processes or tasks where sequential navigation is not necessary.
- For very long processes with a large number of steps. In such cases consider a progress bar.


## Layouts

### Horizontal
Horizontal steppers are helpful when the content of each step relies on the completion of a previous step.
