# Stepper
The stepper guides users through a step-by-step process. It provides a clear visual representation of progress and allows users to navigate between steps.

## Usage

### When to use
- When you have a multi-step process or task that needs to be visually represented and guided.
- If you need to simplify complex workflows by breaking them down into manageable steps.
- When you need to provide users with a clear sense of progress and to keep them engaged in the process.

### When not to use
- For simple, single-step processes or tasks where sequential navigation is not necessary.
- For very long processes with a large number of steps. In such cases consider a progress bar.


## Layouts

### Horizontal
Horizontal steppers are helpful when the content of each step relies on the completion of a previous step.

### Vertical
Vertical steppers are tailored for narrow screens.

### Compact
The compact stepper is a streamlined version of the default stepper component, optimized for mobile devices with limited screen space.

## Types of steps

### Editable
Editable steps enable users to revisit and modify a step at any point.

### Non-editable
Non-editable steps are used when users are not allowed to modify a step once it is completed.

## Responsive behaviour
The stepper is designed to be fully responsive, adjusting dynamically to its parent container's width. This adaptability allows the stepper to integrate seamlessly into different UI layouts, whether it is displayed in narrow side panels or wide content areas.

> We recommend to use a connector min-width of 80px.
