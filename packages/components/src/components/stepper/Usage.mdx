# Stepper
The stepper guides users through a step-by-step process. It provides a clear visual representation of progress and allows users to navigate between steps.

## Usage

### When to use
- When you have a multi-step process or task that needs to be visually represented and guided.
- If you need to simplify complex workflows by breaking them down into manageable steps.
- When you need to provide users with a clear sense of progress and to keep them engaged in the process.

### When not to use
- For simple, single-step processes or tasks where sequential navigation is not necessary.
- For very long processes with a large number of steps. In such cases consider a progress bar.


## Variants

### Default Stepper
The linear stepper displays the steps in a linear, sequential order, with a clear indication of the current active step. Users can progress through the steps in a linear fashion, completing each step before moving on to the next. This type of stepper is suitable for processes that require a strict sequence of steps.

#### Horizontal
Horizontal steppers are helpful when the content of each step relies on the completion of a previous step.

#### Vertical (compact)
Vertical steppers are tailored for narrow screens, making them ideal for mobile devices.

## Types of steps

### Editable
Editable steps enable users to revisit and modify a step at any point.

### Non-editable
Non-editable steps are used when users are not allowed to modify a step once it is completed.
