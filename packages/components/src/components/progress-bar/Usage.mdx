# Progress Bar
The Progress bar is a control element that visually represents the progress of a job or task. It provides feedback to users about the completion status of a process, such as installation or loading.

## Usage

### When to use
- When you need to visually represent the progress or completion status of a task or process.
- To show continuous progress, where the progress bar moves continuously until the task is completed.
- When you want to provide users with additional numerical information about the progress.

### When not to use
- When there is no relevant task or process that needs to be visually represented to the user.
- If the progress is not measurable or if the progress does not have a clear endpoint.
- If the progress you are trying to convey is better represented through alternative means, such as a spinner or alert messages

## Anatomy
<img src={ProgressBarAnatomy} alt="Progress Bar Anatomy" />


**Fill (1)**\
Shows the current progress of the bar.


**Value (2)**\
Can be displayed to give additional %-information.


**Track (3)**\
The horizontal bar that represents the entire progress range.


## Size
There are two different sizes of the progress bar available: 4px and 20px.

### 20px
This is the default size for the progress bar, suitable for most use cases where a normal visual presence is desired.

### 4px
This size is ideal for situations where space is limited or a more compact representation of the progress bar is needed.

## Progress behavior
Implement a technical solution so the progress bar always starts at **2% of its maximum progress (instead of 0%)**.  Avoid starting at 0% as it can be frustrating for the user if progress really takes a few seconds to start.
