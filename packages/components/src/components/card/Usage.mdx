# Card
The card component provides users with a flexible layout for displaying various types of content. Cards can accommodate different functionalities, content types, and sizes, allowing designers to create visually appealing and informative card-based interfaces.

### When to use

## Layouts

### Vertical
The vertical card Layout is the default and most commonly used layout. It consists of a single column of content and is ideal for presenting a compact summary of information.

### Horizontal
The horizontal layout is an alternative style of the card component, optimized for displaying content in a horizontal arrangement. It is particularly useful for showcasing images and brief descriptions. It is also possible to switch the image- and textual area. Note that some functionalities available in the vertical layout may not be applicable to the horizontal layout. For example, there is no "Button" and "Text Link" available.
<img src={CardHorizontalAlign} alt="Card Horizontal Align" />

## Mouse interactions
The card without buttons or links is completely clickable and leads the user to its corresponding detail page. It is also possible to add another action area to the card where you can insert buttons or links. The action area itself is not hoverable/clickable, so that the buttons and links have enough interactive space.

### No Button/Link
Simple card which is linked to a specific internal page.
<img src={CardSimple} alt="Card Simple" />


### Bold Link
The card may contain "text" links that offer additional actions to the user. For example, "Quick view" or "Data sheet" links provide quick access to specific actions related to the card content before clicking on the card itself. A **maximum of three** links are allowed.

#### Icon right
A link can be also combined with a right aligned arrow icon. This link variant could be used to redirect the user to a new page and not the corresponding one. A **maximum of three** links are allowed.

<img src={CardWithRedirectLink} alt="Card With Redirect Link" />


### Button
Buttons can be included, which serves as a direct action to improve or modify the content presented in the card. The primary, secondary and tertiary button can be used. Consider to place the **[buttons by importance](https://infineon.github.io/infineon-design-system-stencil/?path=/docs/components-button--usage)**.
Use cases can be showing a CTA inside a card (e.g. sign-up process) or if you want to differentiate the CTAs being shown (e.g., Sign-up (Primary Button), Remind me later (Secondary Button) , Don’t ask me again (Tertiary)). A **maximum of three** buttons are allowed.

<img src={CardHorizontalSecondActionArea} alt="Card Horizontal Second First Action Area" />


## States
The card has two different states: default and hover. While hovering over a card the card-border and the card-title is colored in ocean-500. While hovering over the buttons and links, the respective states become active and the whole card keeps its default state.

### Vertical

### Horizontal
