# Slider
The slider component allows users to select a value or a range of values within a specified numeric range. It provides a visual representation of a continuous scale with adjustable handles, enabling users to slide and select desired values.

## Usage

### When to use
- When you need to allow users to select a specific value or a range of values within a defined numeric range.
- When precise control over the selected values is required, such as input ranges.

### When not to use
- If the range of values is extremely limited or has a small number of discrete options.
- If the input requires highly precise or specific numeric values.
- If the available space for the range slider component is constrained, and displaying the full range or a large number of values becomes visually challenging.
- If the numeric range is complex or non-linear, with varying intervals or irregular increments.
