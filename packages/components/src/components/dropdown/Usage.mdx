### Filter search
The Filter Search feature offers the possibility to filter inside a dropdown menu. This is very helpful if there is a lot of data which can be filtered in order to e.g. filter the output of a data table. The Filter Search feature can be applied to any other trigger like a simple icon or a link.

- Due to the scrolling behavior, the Filter Search is fixed at the top.

## Trigger
A dropdown menu is placed directly under it’s triggers bounding box. A trigger can be for example a button, a text link or an icon button.

## Scrolling behavior
To enhance user experience, it is advisable to display a portion equal to 50% of the container height for the last item, even when scroll bars are not enabled. This serves as a visual cue that there is additional content within the menu. Starting the scroll at the sixth option in the menu is a suggested approach. In some cases the optimal starting point may differ depending on your specific use case.

Indicates that there is more to scroll.
