# Dropdown Menu
The dropdown menu drops-down when a trigger is clicked. There are different dropdown menu items that are used dependent on the function.

## Usage

### When to use
- When you want to avoid cluttering the screen with numerous options.
- When you want to present a list of options which can be opened with any trigger.

### When not to use
- When you want to present a list of options which can be opened with a select field. Use a select instead.
- When you want to provide additional menu links in the navbar. Use a submenu instead.

## Variants

**Default**\
Our default menu items which can be used or combined with different properties.


**Icons**\
It is possible to use icons on the left side of the menu item.


**Divider**\
Use a divider to provide a clear distinction between different categories of options.


**Header**\
It is possible to use a descriptive heading that summarizes the actions that can be made in the drop-down menu.


### Filter search
The Filter Search feature offers the possibility to filter inside a dropdown menu. This is very helpful if there is a lot of data which can be filtered in order to e.g. filter the output of a data table. The Filter Search feature can be applied to any other trigger like a simple icon or a link.

- The Filter Search variant is always located at the top of a drop-down menu.  
- Due to the scrolling behavior, the Filter Search is fixed at the top.  

##### Autocomplete
The system suggests possible search queries or completions as users type in their search terms.

## Trigger
A dropdown menu is placed directly under itâ€™s triggers bounding box. A trigger can be for example a button, a text link or an icon button.

## Scrolling behavior
To enhance user experience, it is advisable to display a portion equal to 50% of the container height for the last item, even when scroll bars are not enabled. This serves as a visual cue that there is additional content within the menu. Starting the scroll at the sixth option in the menu is a suggested approach. In some cases the optimal starting point may differ depending on your specific use case.

**Scroll bar (1)**\
Can be optionally displayed if there are lots of menu items in the dropdown. The bar is browser native.


**Clipped menu(2)**\
Indicates that there is more to scroll.


## Size
There are two dropdown menu sizes: 40px (Large) and 36px (Small).
