# Tree View
The tree view component presents hierarchical data in a structured, expandable format. It enables users to navigate complex information architectures by expanding or collapsing nodes, revealing nested content as needed.

## Usage
### When to use
- When users need to display data with multiple levels, such as directories, categories, or organizational structures.
- When users need to explore data incrementally, expanding only the sections relevant to them.
- If applications requiring navigation through deeply nested information.

### When not to use
- Using tree view as the main navigation. Use dedicated navigation patterns for primary site navigation.

**Branch node (1)**\
This node is any item in the tree hierarchy that has at least one child nodes beneath it.


**Leaf node (2)**\
Leaf nodes are the final items you can’t expand anymore—theyn’t have any further levels under them.


**Chevron (3)**\
Used to either expand or collapse a child tree view.


**Checkbox (4)**\
Use a checkbox to select multiple items across the tree structure.


**Icon (5)**\
Icons clarify tree view entries by signaling content types, making the hierarchy more navigable.


**Label (6)**\
Use a label to describe the purpose of the tree view item to the user.


**Subordinate branch node (7)**\
Another branch node which is under its parental branch node.
