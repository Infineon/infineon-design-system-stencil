# Radio Button
The radio component is used to allow users to select a single option from a predefined list. It represents a mutually exclusive choice, where only one option can be selected at a time.

## Usage

### When to use
- When you want to provide users with the ability to select a single option from a list.
- When the options are mutually exclusive, and selecting one option automatically deselects the others.

### When not to use
- When multiple selections are allowed. In such cases, checkboxes are more appropriate.
- If the options are independent and not mutually exclusive, checkboxes should be used instead.

## Anatomy

**Radio Button input (1)**
A radio button indicating the appropriate state. By default an option is selected. In some UX cases it is also possible to let the state unselected.


**Radio Button label (2)**
Provides an information you want to select or unselect.

## Size
The radio button component in our design system is available in two different sizes: 20px and 24px. These sizes are designed to provide flexibility and meet various design requirements.

## Grouping radio buttons
Deciding whether to place radio buttons in an inline or block layout depends on the specific context and requirements of your user interface.

### Inline
<img src={RadioButtonGroupInline} alt="Radio Button grouping inline" width="50%" />

- Use to save space when you have limited screen real estate or need to place other elements alongside the radio buttons. 
- Use when the options in your radio button group have short labels, an inline layout can provide a more compact and visually streamlined presentation. 
- Use to visually group related options or indicate that they belong to the same category.

### Block
<img src={RadioButtonGroupBlock} alt="Radio Button grouping block" width="50%" />

- Use for long radio button labels. 
- Use to easily scan and compare the options from top to bottom. 
- Use to visually separate radio button options.

## Mouse interaction
To select the radio button, users have two options: they can either directly click on the radio button or click on the label.

## Overflow content
When the content associated with a radio button option is too long or exceeds the available space, it can lead to an overflow scenario. In that case the long labels may wrap to a second line.
