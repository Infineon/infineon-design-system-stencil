# Sidebar
For dashboards or similar functional application we provide a different and usually common variant of navigation. The sidebar gives users an easy access to different sections.

## Anatomy of default sidebar

**Logo (1)**\
The header always starts with the brand logo.


**Application name (2)**\
The application name is always shown below the brand logo.
 

**Main Menu item list (3)**\
To navigate through different sections and pages. It is possible to attach a supportive icon before the menu item-labels.


**Divider (4)**\
To visually cluster different sub menus or to differentiate the sticky footer from the rest above.


**Cluster Title (5)**\
This menu item opens another subordinate menu. It is always denoted with a chevron-down icon to the right. The cluster title has always a divider above. Do not use any icons before this menu item.


**Footer (6)**\
The footer at the bottom can be displayed optionally. The text links within the footer are displayed in one line and wrapped if they become too long. A dividing line at the top indicates the margin of the footer.


**Border (7)**\
A 1px border indicates the right edge of the sidebar at anytime.


**Number Indicator (8)**\
Informs the user about the amount of unseen content inside the menu item's page.

**Expanded menu item (4)**\

Opens a subordinated menu when you click on the referenced cluster title. It is possible to attach a supportive icon before the menu item-labels.
