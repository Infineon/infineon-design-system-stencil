# Sidebar
For dashboards or similar functional application we provide a different and usually common variant of navigation. The sidebar gives users an easy access to different sections.

The footer at the bottom can be displayed optionally. The text links within the footer are displayed in one line and wrapped if they become too long. A dividing line at the top indicates the margin of the footer.
