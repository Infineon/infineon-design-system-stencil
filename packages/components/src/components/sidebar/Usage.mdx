# Sidebar Navigation
For dashboards or similar functional application we provide a different and usually common variant of navigation. The sidebar navigation gives users an easy access to different sections.

**Logo (1)**
The header always starts with the brand logo.

**Application name (2)**
The application name is always shown below the brand logo.
 
**Main Menu item list (3)**
To navigate through different sections and pages. It is possible to attach a supportive icon before the menu item-labels.

**Divider (4)**
To visually cluster different sub menus or to differentiate the sticky footer from the rest above.

**Cluster tile (5)**
This item opens another subordinate menu. It is always denoted with a chevron-down icon to the right. The cluster tile has always a divider above. Do not use any icons before this menu item.

**Footer (6)**
The bottom-sticked footer can be displayed optional. The text links inside the footer are displayed in line and break if they become to long. A divider on top indicates the footer's edge.

**Search field (7)**
If needed the search field can be displayed inside the sidebar's navigation bar.

**Secondary navigation (8)**
Crucial functions can be placed here. Please pay attention to the placement by priority. [Read more "Header navigation"](link)

A 1px border indicates the bottom edge of the navigation bar and the right edge of the sidebar at anytime.
