## Notes
Each Sidebar Item is a navigation item per default (``isActionItem=false``), meaning it becomes active ``active=true`` on selection. 
The ``active`` property can also be set manually, e.g. in the case of pre-selecting an item.
Setting ``isActionItem=true`` means turning a navigation item into an action item. Action items do not become active on selection.
The previously active state is maintained during the action triggered by selecting an action item.

#### Examples:

<b>Navigation item:</b> Loading a new page

<b>Action item:</b> Opening a modal overlay, while staying on the currently active page
