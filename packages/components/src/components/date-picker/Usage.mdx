# Date picker
The date picker allows users to select a date from a combination of an input field and a calendar view. It is essential for our applications where date input is required.

## Usage

### When to use
- If you want to select a date or a range of dates by allow users to navigate through months and years.

### When not to use
- If the date options are limited to a few predefined values, a dropdown menu or a set of radio buttons might be more appropriate than a date picker.

## Anatomy

**Label (1)**\
Use a label to describe the purpose of the date field to the user.


**Required field (2)**\
Mark a date field as required when the information is necessary for the user to proceed with a specific action, such as submitting a form. It is indicated with an asterisk (*) next to the label.


**Input field (3)**\
For this `<input>` we use the `type="date"` which enables users to enter a date.


 **Date icon (4)**\
By clicking the date icon a calendar view will appear.


**Date element (5)**\
Each date element (e.g. DD, MM, YYYY) is clickable and editable via keyboard.


**Caption text (6)**\
If required, use caption text to provide additional context or information about the date field.


**Calendar view (7)**\
The calendar view provides a visual representation of a calendar, enabling users to navigate through months and years to select a specific date.

## States

## Size
There are two date field sizes: 36px and 40px. This will give you more flexibility in structuring layouts due to e.g. different button heights. It's important to maintain uniform field height while combining form elements on a single page.
