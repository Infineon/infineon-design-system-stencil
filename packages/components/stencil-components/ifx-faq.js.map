Its purpose is to support internal and external colleagues create digital user interfaces with a high level of usability as well as a consistent expression of the Infineon brand. The DDS does not focus on the content of a web application but it describes how the design of the applicationâ€™s structure should be.\r\n        </ifx-accordion-item>\r\n        <ifx-accordion-item caption=\"How do I get access to the DDS?\">\r\n          You can use the provided Figma file as a foundation for mockups and prototypes, use Storybook to view what UI components and variants are available and use code components provided via Storybook or Github.\r\n        </ifx-accordion-item>\r\n        <ifx-accordion-item caption=\"Can I integrate the Infineon DDS into my project?\">\r\n          Yes, you can. We are happy to discuss with you which point in time and which scope of integration is bestsuited for updating your interface to the Infineon DDS. (To avoid that users get confused by a mixture of UI components, we recommend choosing larger updates or technology changes as opportunity to integrate the Infineon DDS.)\r\n        </ifx-accordion-item>\r\n        <ifx-accordion-item caption=\"Are Infineon DDS components accessable?\">\r\n          We have taken WCAG 2.0 Level AA as baseline level for all design decisions inside the Infineon Digital Design System. To make an online experience truly accessible you have to implement the specific code, content, and visual design according to the accessibility standard.
