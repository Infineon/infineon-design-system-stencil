# Angular Standalone Example App
This Angular application demonstrates the usage of the Infineon Design System Stencil components in standalone mode.

## Installation and Setup
First, install the Infineon Design System Stencil components in your Angular application.
```bash
npm install @infineon/infineon-design-system-angular
```

Then you need to import the required components into your Angular component.
For example, to use the `ifx-alert` component, you would do the following:
[app.component.ts](./src/app/app.component.ts):
```typescript
@Component({
  imports: [ IfxAlert ],
  // ...
})
export class App {
// ...
}
```

Finally, you can use the components in your Angular templates as you would with any other Angular component.
[app.component.html](./src/app/app.component.html):
```html
<ifx-alert  variant="primary" icon="c-info-16">Attention! This is an alert message!</ifx-alert>
```

## Running the Example App
To run the example app in development mode, use the following command:
```bash
pnpm run -F angular-standalone-example dev
```

This will start a development server and you can access the app at `http://localhost:3003`.

To build the example app for production, use:
```bash
pnpm run -F angular-standalone-example build
```

To preview the built example app, use:
```bash
pnpm run -F angular-standalone-example preview
```

This will start a static file server and you can access the built app at `http://localhost:4003`.
